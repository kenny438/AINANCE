🌀 How Investing Could Work in QNTM + Code Trade

Since you’re building QNTM and Code Trade, you can gamify investing inside your ecosystem:

Programmable Investing (Code Trade)

Users can write code like:
if QNTM price < $1, then buy 500 tokens
or
if BTC dominance drops 5%, shift 20% portfolio to QNTM.

Staking & Yield

Investors stake QNTM for rewards.

Code Trade could let them auto-compound or re-stake based on rules.

Algorithmic Portfolios

Users invest in strategies written as code (almost like ETFs).

Example: “10% ETH, 20% BTC, 70% QNTM, rebalance weekly.”

Risk Profiles

Beginner mode: safe auto-invest features.

Pro mode: full coding power to customize investments.

Social Investing

Users share their strategies (like GitHub for trading code).

New investors can copy or pay to use top performers’ code.
